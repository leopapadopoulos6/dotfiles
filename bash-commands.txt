lavat
(Usage: lavat [OPTIONS]
OPTIONS:
  -c <COLOR>          Set color. Available colours: red, blue, yellow, green, cyan, magenta, white and black.
  -s <SPEED>          Set the speed, from 1 to 10. (default 5)
  -r <RADIUS>         Set the radius of the metaballs, from 1 to 10. (default: 5)
  -R <RIM>            Set a rim for each metaball, sizes from 1 to 5.(default: none)
                      This option does not work with the default color
                      If you use Kitty or Alacritty you must use it with the -k option to see the rim.
  -k <COLOR>          Set the color of the rim if there is one. Available colours: red, blue, yellow, green, cyan, magenta, white and black.
  -b <NBALLS>         Set the number of metaballs in the simulation, from 5 to 20. (default: 10)
  -F <CHARS>          Allows for a custom set of chars to be used
                      Only ascii symbols are supported for now, wide/unicode chars may appear broken.
  -C                  Retain the entire lava inside the terminal.
                      It may not work well with a lot of balls or with a bigger radius than the default one.
  -p <MODE>           PARTY!! THREE MODES AVAILABLE (p1, p2 and p3).
  -h                  Print help.
RUNTIME CONTROLS:
  i                   Increase radius of the metaballs.
  d                   Decrease radius of the metaballs.
  shift i             Increase rim of the metaballs.
  shift d             Decrease rim of the metaballs.
  m                   Increase the number of metaballs.
  l                   Decrease the number metaballs.
  c                   Change the color of the metaballs.
  k                   Change the rim color of the metaballs.
  +                   Increase speed.
  -                   Decrease speed.
  p                   TURN ON THE PARTY AND CYCLE THROUGH THE PARTY MODES (it can also turns off the party).
(Tip: Zoom out in your terminal before running the program to get a better resolution of the lava).)
